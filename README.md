*Important:* currently its only working with > node 12.. I use node 11.15.0 using NVM to switch between node version.. Hoping to fix this issue in the future. 

I've forked this project to try and keep it active.

Fix #1: Updated packages.json so that it builds properly.

Update #1: Made Tile Menu work in Full screen mode.

Update #2 Updated CDN.

Update #3 Added tiles_min_columns, tiles_max_columns, tiles_justified_row_height options to tile gallery (see unitegallery - https://unitegallery.net/)

Update #4: Added polyfill.css to Tilesmenu webpart as it was not displaying some icons.. TODO : add this file to all webparts.
